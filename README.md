## Implementation Strategies

### For Object Detection on Drones

1. **Dataset Combination:**
   - Primary: VisDrone (for scale and diversity)
   - Supplementary: UAVDT (for vehicle-specific detection)
   - Fine-tuning: Domain-specific smaller datasets

2. **Model Selection:**
   - YOLOv5/v8 for balanced speed/accuracy
   - EfficientDet for resource-constrained platforms
   - SSD MobileNet for extreme resource constraints

3. **Training Strategy:**
   - Transfer learning from COCO pre-trained models
   - Progressive resolution training
   - Mixed precision training for efficiency
   - Data augmentation focusing on viewpoint and lighting variations

### For Drone Detection Systems

1. **Dataset Combination:**
   - Primary: DroneDetectionDataset (for scale)
   - Supplementary: Kaggle Drone Dataset (for diversity)
   - Fine-tuning: Roboflow datasets (for specialized scenarios)

2. **Model Selection:**
   - Faster R-CNN for high accuracy requirements
   - YOLOv5/v8 for balanced performance
   - TinyYOLO for edge deployment

3. **Training Strategy:**
   - Hard negative mining
   - Focal loss to address class imbalance
   - Extensive augmentation (scale, blur, noise)
   - Consider multi-modal approaches (RGB + thermal if available)
